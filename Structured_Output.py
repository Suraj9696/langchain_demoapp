response = structured_model.invoke("The Java Fullstack training program was well-structured and covered essential modules like Core Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Angular. The hands-on projects and live coding sessions made it easier to apply concepts in real-world scenarios. The trainer was knowledgeable and supportive, and the sessions on Git and deployment provided a complete view of end-to-end development. However, the pace during the Spring Boot section felt a bit fast, and more time for practice would have been helpful. Additionally, a dedicated session on debugging and code optimization could enhance the learning experience. Some front-end sessions, especially on Angular, felt rushed, and could benefit from more real-time examples. Out of 5 I would give 4 rating for this program. Feedback given by Suraj Tawale")
